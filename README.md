# Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram

This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram.

[view in browser](https://hankadev.github.io/d3_tree_map_diagram/) 

## Objective

Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/KaNGNR/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style. You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library.

Datasets provided by freeCodeCamp can be found [here](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/tree_map/movie-data.json).

User stories:

- **User Story #1:** My tree map should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.
- **User Story #2:** My tree map should have a description with a corresponding `id="description"`.
- **User Story #3:** My tree map should have rect elements with a corresponding `class="tile"` that represent the data.
- **User Story #4:** There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles.
- **User Story #5:** Each tile should have the properties `data-name`, `data-category`, and `data-value` containing their corresponding name, category, and value.
- **User Story #6:** The area of each tile should correspond to the data-value amount: tiles with a larger data-value should have a bigger area.
- **User Story #7:** My tree map should have a legend with corresponding `id="legend"`.
- **User Story #8:** My legend should have `rect` elements with a corresponding `class="legend-item"`.
- **User Story #9:** The `rect` elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors.
- **User Story #10:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
- **User Story #11:** My tooltip should have a `data-value` property that corresponds to the `data-value` of the active area.
